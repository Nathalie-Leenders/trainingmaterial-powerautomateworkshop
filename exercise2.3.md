# Exercise 2.3: Adding Flow Steps to the Business Process Flow

In this exercise, you will learn how to add flow steps to a Business Process Flow (BPF). Ensure you have created at least one flow before proceeding.

## Steps

1. **Open the Business Process Flow**:
    - Navigate to the BPF you want to edit.

2. **Add Flow Steps**:
    - Click on the stage where you want to add the flow step.
    - Select "Add" and then choose "Flow Step".
    - Select the flow you have created from the list.

3. **Configure the Flow Step**:
    - Set the necessary parameters and conditions for the flow step.
    - Save and publish the BPF.

4. **Test the Business Process Flow**:
    - Run the BPF to ensure the flow steps are triggered correctly.
    - Verify that the corresponding flow executes as expected.

## Verification

- Ensure the flow steps are correctly added and configured.
- Test the BPF to confirm that the flow steps are working as intended.

By following these steps, you will successfully integrate flow steps into your Business Process Flow and ensure they function correctly.
