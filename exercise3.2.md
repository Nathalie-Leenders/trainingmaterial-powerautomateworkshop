# Parsing Input and Output from Copilot Studio through Power Automate Flows and Custom Connectors

## Introduction
This guide will help you understand how to parse input and output from Copilot Studio using Power Automate flows and custom connectors.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Power Automate
- Basic knowledge of creating flows
- Access to Copilot Studio

## Steps

### 1. Create a Custom Connector
1. Navigate to Power Automate.
2. Go to **Data** > **Custom connectors**.
3. Click **+ New custom connector** and choose **Create from blank**.
4. Enter a name for your connector and click **Continue**.
5. Define the connector's general information, including the host URL for Copilot Studio.

### 2. Define the Connector's Actions
1. Go to the **Definition** tab.
2. Click **+ New action**.
3. Provide a name and description for the action.
4. Define the request by specifying the HTTP method, URL, and headers.
5. Define the response by specifying the expected output format.

### 3. Create a Flow
1. Navigate to **My flows** and click **+ New flow**.
2. Choose the type of flow you want to create (e.g., Automated, Instant, Scheduled).
3. Add a trigger to start the flow.

### 4. Add the Custom Connector to the Flow
1. Click **+ New step**.
2. Search for your custom connector and select it.
3. Choose the action you defined earlier.
4. Configure the action by providing the necessary input parameters.

### 5. Parse the Input and Output
1. Use the **Compose** action to parse the input data.
2. Use the **Parse JSON** action to parse the output data.
3. Define the schema for the JSON data to ensure proper parsing.

### 6. Test the Flow
1. Save the flow.
2. Click **Test** to run the flow and verify that the input and output are parsed correctly.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can successfully parse input and output from Copilot Studio using Power Automate flows and custom connectors.

## Understanding Input and Output Parameters/Variables in Copilot Studio

### Input Parameters
Input parameters are the data that you send to Copilot Studio when making a request. These parameters can be used to customize the behavior of the actions defined in your custom connector.

1. **Defining Input Parameters**:
    - When creating or editing an action in your custom connector, you can define input parameters by specifying their names, types, and descriptions.
    - Input parameters can be of various types such as string, integer, boolean, etc.

2. **Using Input Parameters in Flows**:
    - When configuring the action in your flow, you will be prompted to provide values for the input parameters.
    - These values can be static or dynamically generated based on previous steps in the flow.

### Output Variables
Output variables are the data that you receive from Copilot Studio in response to your request. These variables contain the results of the action performed by the custom connector.

1. **Defining Output Variables**:
    - In the **Definition** tab of your custom connector, you can specify the expected output format for each action.
    - This includes defining the schema for the JSON response to ensure that the output data is correctly parsed.

2. **Using Output Variables in Flows**:
    - After the action is executed, the output variables can be used in subsequent steps of the flow.
    - You can use actions like **Compose** and **Parse JSON** to extract and manipulate the output data as needed.

### Example
Consider an action that retrieves user information from Copilot Studio. The input parameter might be the user ID, and the output variables could include the user's name, email, and role.

By understanding and correctly configuring input and output parameters/variables, you can ensure seamless integration and data flow between Copilot Studio and Power Automate.
